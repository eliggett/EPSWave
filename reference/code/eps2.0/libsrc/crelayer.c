/****** eps.lib/epsCreateLayer ******************************************
*
*   NAME   
*	epsCreateLayer -- create a new layer
*
*   SYNOPSIS
*	error = epsCreateLayer( eps, inst )
*
*	int epsCreateLayer( struct EPSdesc *, edit_spec * );
*
*   FUNCTION
*	Create a new layer within the instrument given by `inst'.
*
*   INPUTS
*	eps		- descriptor for the EPS to send the command to.
*	inst		- number of the instrument in which to create the
*			  new layer.
*
*   RESULT
*	error - zero for success, a positive number giving the last response
*		returned by the EPS, or a negative number in case of library
*		error.
*
*   NOTES
*	The EPS ignores any layer number given in `inst'. I haven't made a
*	rigorous analysis of how it allocates the next layer number.
*
*   SEE ALSO
*	epsCopyLayer(), epsDeleteLayer()
